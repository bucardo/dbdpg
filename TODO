TODO: 

- Play nicely with standard_confirming_strings (CPAN bug #27538)
- Use WITH HOLD for cursor work
- Start testing with a thread-enabled Perl.
- Support for bind_param_inout
- Support for new error protocol
- Support new DBI trace scheme.
- Create a .ppm for Windows
- Change quote and dequote functions to take Sv instead of string so that
   things like arrays can be serialized by the quote function.  This will
   take care of broken chopblanks and pg_bool_tf (pass the  quote/dequote 
   options struct to function quote/dequote functions).
- Implement a clean UTF-8 support.
- Allow user callbacks to quote user-defined types?
- Rename functions and add defines to avoid problems with static linking of multi DBDs
- Move to the Module::Build system
- Remove libpq dependency
