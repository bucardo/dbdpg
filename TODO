- Make all tests work when server and/or client encoding is SQL_ASCII
- Enable native JSON decoding, similar to arrays, perhaps with JSON::PP
- Allow partial result sets, either via PQsetSingleRowMode or something better
- Hack libpq to make user-defined number of rows returned
- Map hstore to hashes ala array/array mapping
- Fix ping problem: http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/53c5cc72-6d39-11e1-8b9d-82c3d2d9ea9f
- Use WITH HOLD for cursor work
- Devise a way to automatically create ppm for Windows builds
- I8N docs and error messages
- Change quote and dequote functions to take Sv instead of string so that
   things like arrays can be serialized by the quote function.  This will
   take care of broken chopblanks and pg_bool_tf (pass the quote/dequote 
   options struct to function quote/dequote functions)
- Allow user callbacks to quote user-defined types
- Revisit the use of version.pm
- Test heavily with a thread-enabled Perl
- Remove libpq dependency
- Handle and/or better tests for different encoding, especially those not 
   supported as a server encoding (e.g. BIG5)
- Support passing hashrefs in and out for custom types.
- Support a flag for behind-the-scenes CURSOR to emulate partial fetches.
- Composite type support: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/rowtypes.html
- Full support for execute_array, e.g. the return values
- Fix array support: execute([1,2]) not working as expected, deep arrays not returned correctly.
- Support RaiseError on $sth from closed $dbh (GH #28)
