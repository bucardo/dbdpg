  - Allow '%' again for the type in table_info() and thus tables()
    It's not documented or tested in DBI, but it used to work until
    DBD::Pg 3.4.0, and the change broke DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader, which
    uses type='%'.
    [Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker]


Version 3.4.0  (released August 16, 2014)

  - Cleanup and improve table_info()
    [Mike Pomraning <mjp@pilcrow.madison.wi.us>] (github issue #7)

    table_info() type searching now supports TABLE, VIEW, SYSTEM TABLE,
      SYSTEM VIEW, and LOCAL TEMPORARY

    table_info() object searching fully supports the above types.

    table_info() object searching no longer ignores invalid types - a filter 
      of 'NOSUCH' will return no rows, and 'NOSUCH,LOCAL TEMPORARY' will
      return only temp objects.

    tableinfo() type filters are strictly matched now ... previously a 
      search for SYSTEM TABLE would have fetched plain TABLE objects.

    table_info() now treats temporary tables and temporary views as LOCAL TEMPORARY

  - Make sure column_info() and table_info() can handle materialized views.
    [Greg Sabino Mullane] (CPAN bug #97032)

      Test that characters created in the server reach the client correctly.

Version 3.0.0  (released February 3, 2014)

Version 1.31  (released November 17, 2003)

  - $dbh->{TYPE} now returns SQL_TYPE_TIMESTAMP instead of 1114 for

    but reported by ["Hirche, Joachim" <Joachim.Hirche@cimconcepts.com>]).

  - Notice messages generated by the database now use the perl 
    warning mechanism instead of going to stderr.
    [Dominic Mitchell <dom@semantico.com>]
  - $dbh->prepare() rewrites the SQL statement into an internal form,
    striping out comments and whitespace, and if PostgreSQL > 7.3 takes the 
    stripped statement and passes that to Postgres' PREPARE statement, 
    then rewrites the statement as 'EXECUTE "DBD::PG::cached_query n"
    ($1, $2, ... $n, $n+1)' for DBD::Pg's execute.
    -- Currently disabled until PREPARE works a little better
  - Allows the use of :n and :foo bind params. So: 
    (SELECT * FROM foo WHERE 1 = :this and 2 = :that) will now work.
  - Complains on execute when unbound bind params are submitted
    (instead of defaulting to NULL)
  - Switched over to use driver.xst.
  - pg_error() removes \n's rather than truncating the message on the first \n.
  - Fixed statement scan problem where the preparse of
    "SELECT foo[3:33] from bar" was scanning :33 as a placeholder
  - Moved the quoting of bind values out of execute() and into
    bind -- as there is no need to requote the value every time execute 
    is called.
  - :veryverylongplaceholdername == Long walk, short pier -- fixed.
  - quote() is now in C and uses same code as bind_param.
  - Quoting and dequoting now use libpq quoting functions where available
    (I still need to take the libpq functions swiped out of quote.c and move 
    it into libpqswip.c with license info &c., and switch ifndefs to ifdefs)
  - bind_param() will convert from 1,0 to TRUE/FALSE when pg_type
    is PGBOOLOID.
  - Fixed many heap buffer overruns.
  - Added support for the get_info() method [Greg Sabino Mullane]
  - Added tests for POD validation [Mark Stosberg]
  - Several improvements to column_info, including:
    - Fixed column_info so NULLABLE field shows correctly. [kevin@sysexperts.com]
    - REMARKS field works now [Mark Stosberbg]
    - COLUMN_DEF fixed
    - COLUMN_SIZE fixed
    - pg_constraint column added to display column constraints

  - make test is now more intelligent and will bail out early if
    db connection fails. [Greg Sabino Mullane]

    rather than files. Contributed by Garth Webb.

  - Deprecated the undocumented (and invalid) use of SQL_BINARY in
    bind_param() and documented the correct approach: "bind_param($num,
    $val { pg_type => PG_BYTEA });". Use of SQL_BINARY in bind_param() will
    now issue a warning if $h->{Warn} is true. [David Wheeler]
  - Removed invalid (and broken) support for SQL_BINARY in quote().
    [David Wheeler]
  - Added App::Info::RDBMS::PostgreSQL to the distribution (but it won't
    be installed) to help Makefile.PL find the PostgreSQL include and
