 - Fix missing "use File::Temp"
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]
   (Github issue #79)

   Previously, $dbh->{pg_async} would return undef.
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]
   (RT ticket #136553)

 - Adjust tests for the fact that reltuples can be -1 in Postgres
     version 14 and later. This is mostly reflected in the CARDINALITY
     column for $dbh->statistics_info.
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

 - Remove the experimental 'fulltest' Makefile target.
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]
   (RT ticket #136567)

   [Greg Sabino Mullane]
   (RT ticket #83057)


Version 3.14.0  (released July 19, 2020)

 - The $dbh->primary_key_info and $dbh->foreign_key_info methods will now always return 
     a statement handle, even with no matches. Previously, they returned undef directly.
   Callers can check if the returned handle contains any rows.
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

 - The $dbh->tables method will always return a list, even if it is empty.
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

     with really, really, really large 'large objects'. Requires Postgres 9.3 or better.
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

   (RT ticket #99144)


Version 3.4.1  (released August 20, 2014)

 - Allow '%' again for the type in table_info() and thus tables()
   It's not documented or tested in DBI, but it used to work until DBD::Pg 3.4.0, 
     and the change broke DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader, which uses type='%'.
   [Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker]


Version 3.4.0  (released August 16, 2014)

 - Cleanup and improve table_info()
   [Mike Pomraning <mjp@pilcrow.madison.wi.us>]
   (Github issue #7)

   Method table_info() type searching now supports TABLE, VIEW, SYSTEM TABLE,
     SYSTEM VIEW, and LOCAL TEMPORARY

   Method table_info() object searching fully supports the above types.

   Method table_info() object searching no longer ignores invalid types - a filter 
     of 'NOSUCH' will return no rows, and 'NOSUCH,LOCAL TEMPORARY' will
     return only temp objects.

   Method tableinfo() type filters are strictly matched now ... previously a 
     search for SYSTEM TABLE would have fetched plain TABLE objects.

   Method table_info() now treats temporary tables and temporary views as LOCAL TEMPORARY

 - Make sure column_info() and table_info() can handle materialized views.
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

   Extend the Unicode round-trip tests to verify ASCII, BMP and non-BMP code points.
   Test that characters created in the server reach the client correctly.
   [Nicholas Clark]

   [Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker]

     warning mechanism instead of going to stderr.
   [Dominic Mitchell <dom at semantico.com>]

 - The $dbh->prepare() method now rewrites the SQL statement into an internal form, stripping out 
     comments and whitespace, and if PostgreSQL > 7.3 it takes the stripped statement and passes 
     that to Postgres' PREPARE statement, then rewrites the statement 
     as 'EXECUTE "DBD::PG::cached_query n" ($1, $2, ... $n, $n+1)' for DBD::Pg::execute.

 - Allows the use of :n and :foo bind params.
   So (SELECT * FROM foo WHERE 1 = :this and 2 = :that) will now work.

 - Complains on execute when unbound bind params are submitted (instead of defaulting to NULL)

 - Switched over to use driver.xst.

 - The pg_error() method removes newlines rather than truncating the message on the first \n.

 - Fixed statement scan problem where the preparse 
     of "SELECT foo[3:33] from bar" was scanning :33 as a placeholder

 - Moved the quoting of bind values out of execute() and into bind -- as there 
     is no need to requote the value every time execute is called.

 - Fixed use of :veryverylongplaceholdername

 - The quote() method is now in C and uses same code as bind_param.

 - Quoting and dequoting now use libpq quoting functions where available

 - The bind_param() method will convert from 1,0 to TRUE/FALSE when pg_type is PGBOOLOID.

 - Fixed many heap buffer overruns.

 - Added support for the get_info() method
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

 - Added tests for POD validation
   [Mark Stosberg]

 - Deprecated the undocumented (and invalid) use of SQL_BINARY in bind_param() and documented 
     the correct approach: "bind_param($num, $val { pg_type => PG_BYTEA });". Use of SQL_BINARY 
     in bind_param() will now issue a warning if $h->{Warn} is true.
   [David Wheeler]

 - Removed invalid (and broken) support for SQL_BINARY in quote().
   [David Wheeler]

 - Added App::Info::RDBMS::PostgreSQL to the distribution (but it won't be installed)
