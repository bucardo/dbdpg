('GSM' is Greg Sabino Mullane, greg@turnstep.com)

2.0.0
	- Allow objects with stringification overloading to work with quote().
		(CPAN bug #32868) [David E. Wheeler and GSM]
	- Make sure arrays handle UTF-8 smoothly (CPAN bug #32479) [GSM]
	- Check transaction status after each command, to allow 
		things such as 'PREPARE TRANSACTION' to work properly.
		(CPAN bug #32423) [GSM]
	- Allow raw transaction statements through - in other words, 
		do not croak if $dbh->prepare("COMMIT") is attempted. Not 
		only was this a little too controlling, there is a growing 
		host of other commands such as "COMMIT PREPARED" that we
		need to allow. [GSM].
	- Be much more flexible in test connection options. [GSM]
	- Skip item if no matching key in foreign_key_info.
		(CPAN bug #32308) [GSM]
	- Overhaul COPY functions: deprecate pg_getline, pg_putline, 
		and pg_endcopy. The new functions are pg_getcopydata, 
		pg_getcopydata_async, pg_putcopydata, and pg_putcopyend. [GSM]
	- Change $dbh->{User} to $dbh->{Username} [GSM]
	- Add three new columns to column_info, to return unquoted 
		version: pg_schema, pg_table, and pg_columns. Add all 
		three to primary_key_info, and the first two to table_info
		(CPAN bug #20282) [GSM]
	- Very experimental support for bind_param_inout, use 
		with caution. [GSM]
	- Switch from pow to powf to support AIX compiler issue.
		(CPAN bug #24579) [GSM]
	- Use adbin, not adsrc, when figuring out the sequence name for the 
		last_insert_id() method. This allows the function to work properly 
		if the sequence name is changed. Note that {pg_cache=>0} should be 
		passed to the function if you expect this might happen.
		(CPAN bug #30924) [GSM]
	- Use unsigned chars when parsing passed-in queries, preventing UTF-8 
		strings from ruining the prepare. UTF-16 may still cause problems.
		(CPAN bug #31577) [GSM]
	- Fix crash when executing query with two placeholders side by side.
		Thanks to Daniel Browning for spotting this. [GSM]
	- Fix bad PG_INTEGER example in docs, thanks to Xavi Drudis Ferran.
		(CPAN bug #31545) [GSM]

	- Change versioning system to three numbered system.
	- Make sure array items are marked as UTF as needed.
		(CPAN bug #29656) [GSM]		
	- Add support for arrays: can pass in arrayrefs to execute, and 
		they are automatically returned as arrays when fetching. [GSM]
	- Overhauled the data type system. [GSM]
	- Fix bug in last_insert_id. (CPAN bug #15918) [orentocy@gmail.com]
	- Complain loudly and fail to proceed if Makefile.PL finds no -lpq [GSM]
	- Fix META.yml file. (CPAN bug #25759) [GSM]
	- Force column names to respect utf8-ness. Per report from Ch Lamprect. [GSM]
	- Add support for asynchronous queries. [GSM]
	- Make minimum supported server 7.4. [GSM]
	- Add private_attribute_info() method. [GSM]
	- Add SQL_INTERVAL and others to types.c [GSM]
	- Change $dbh->{Name} to return the entire DSN string, minus the 
		'dbi:Pg:' part. Thanks to Mark Stosberg for the idea. [GSM]
	- Add $dbh->{pg_placeholder_dollaronly} to allow '?' and other symbols 
		to be used in prepared statements without getting interpreted as 
		placeholders, i.e. the geometric operator '?#' (CPAN bug #24124) [GSM]
	- Use prepare_cached in last_insert_id function. (CPAN bug #24313)
	- Switch from cvs to subversion. Switch from gborg to perl.org.

	- Strip the final newline from error messages, so that die can add 
		in the line number. (CPAN bug #18900) [GSM]
	- Make workaround for PQresultErrorField not returning proper 
		result when an error is set and we are connecting via TCP/IP.
		This allows correct $dbh->state() values. [GSM]
	- Fix incorrect quoting preventing compiling. (CPAN bug #18640)
	- Add support for quoting and binding of geometric types: POINT, 
		LINE, LSEG, BOX, PATH, POLYGON, and CIRCLE. Also added the 
		TID type. [GSM]

1.48 April 5, 2006

		multi-column keys. [GSM]
	- Rewrote the primary_key_info() and primary_key() methods to

	- Switched commit behavior from commit->execute->begin 
		to begin->execute->commit
		[xelah-junk@xelah.com] [GSM]

		in the type_info array would segfault DBD::Pg. 
		(CPAN bugs #4818,4432) [Rudy Lippan]
	- Duplicate rows bug with column_info() REMARKS has been fixed. However,
		support for Postgres 7.1.x which worked briefly for 1.31 has now been
		dropped for this feature. (Mark Stosberg)
	- Bumped required Perl version to 5.6.1 in Makefile.PL. We were already
		already requiring 5.6.1 for Pg.pm since 1.31.
	- Removed extra "return" statement in quote.c to make Solaris happy
		(CPAN bug #4419) [Rudy Lippan]
	- Changed get_info(29) to return (") instead of (\")

1.31 Mon Nov 17 21:21:21 UTC 2003
	- $dbh->{TYPE} now returns SQL_TYPE_TIMESTAMP instead of 1114 for

	- Notice messages generated by the database now use the perl 
		warning mechanism instead of going to stderr.
		[Dominic Mitchell <dom@semantico.com>]
	- $dbh->prepare() rewrites the SQL statement into an internal form,
		striping out comments and whitespace, and if PostgreSQL > 7.3 takes the 
		stripped statement and passes that to Postgres' PREPARE statement, 
		then rewrites the statement as 'EXECUTE "DBD::PG::cached_query n"
		($1, $2, ... $n, $n+1)' for DBD::Pg's execute.
		-- Currently disabled until PREPARE works a little better
	- Allows the use of :n and :foo bind params. So: 
		(SELECT * FROM foo WHERE 1 = :this and 2 = :that) will now work.
	- Complains on execute when unbound bind params are submitted
		(instead of defaulting to NULL)
	- Switched over to use driver.xst.
	- pg_error() removes \n's rather than truncating the message on the first \n.
	- Fixed statement scan problem where the preparse of
		"SELECT foo[3:33] from bar" was scanning :33 as a placeholder
	- Moved the quoting of bind values out of execute() and into
		bind -- as there is no need to requote the value every time execute 
		is called.
	- :veryverylongplaceholdername == Long walk, short pier -- fixed.
	- quote() is now in C and uses same code as bind_param.
	- Quoting and dequoting now use libpq quoting functions where available
		(I still need to take the libpq functions swiped out of quote.c and move 
		it into libpqswip.c with license info &c., and switch ifndefs to ifdefs)
	- bind_param() will convert from 1,0 to TRUE/FALSE when pg_type
		is PGBOOLOID.
	- Fixed many heap buffer overruns.
	- Added support for the get_info() method [GSM]
	- Added tests for POD validation [Mark Stosberg]
	- Several improvements to column_info, including:
		- Fixed column_info so NULLABLE field shows correctly. [kevin@sysexperts.com]
		- REMARKS field works now [Mark Stosberg]
		- COLUMN_DEF fixed
		- COLUMN_SIZE fixed
		- pg_constraint column added to display column constraints
		- additional documentation and tests added
	- make test is now more intelligent and will bail out early if
		db connection fails. [GSM]

	- Added LISTEN/NOTIFY functionality. Contributed by Alex Pilosov.
	- Added constants for common PostgreSQL data types, plus simple tests to
		make sure that they work. These are exportable via 
		"use DBD::Pg qw(:pg_types);". [David Wheeler]
	- Deprecated the undocumented (and invalid) use of SQL_BINARY in
		bind_param() and documented the correct approach: "bind_param($num,
		$val { pg_type => PG_BYTEA });". Use of SQL_BINARY in bind_param() will
		now issue a warning if $h->{Warn} is true. [David Wheeler]
	- Removed invalid (and broken) support for SQL_BINARY in quote().
		[David Wheeler]
	- Added App::Info::RDBMS::PostgreSQL to the distribution (but it won't
		be installed) to help Makefile.PL find the PostgreSQL include and
		library files. [David Wheeler]
	- Fixed compile-time warnings. [David Wheeler and Jason E. Stewart]
