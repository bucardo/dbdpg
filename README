IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:
---------------------

Please send comments and bug-reports to <dbd-general@gborg.postgresql.org>

Please include the output of perl -v and perl -V, the version of PostgreSQL,
the version of DBD-Pg, the version of DBI, and details about your platform
in your bug-report.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

  - build, test and install Perl 5         (at least 5.004)
  - build, test and install the DBI module (at least 1.21)
  - build, test and install PostgreSQL     (at least 6.5)


INSTALLATION:
-------------

The Makefile checks the environment variables POSTGRES_INCLUDE and
POSTGRES_LIB, to find the library libpq.so and the proper include files.
 
1.   perl Makefile.PL
2.   make
3.   make test
4.   make install

( 1. to 3. as normal user, not as root ! )



TESTING:
--------

The tests are designed to connect to a live database.  The following
environment variables must be set for the tests to run:

DBDPG_MAINTAINER=1
DBDPG_TEST_HOST=<hostname>
DBDPG_TEST_DB=<database>
DBDPG_TEST_USER=<user>
DBDPG_TEST_PASS=<password>

If you are using the shared library libpq.so check if your dynamic loader 
finds libpq.so. With Linux the command /sbin/ldconfig -v should tell you, 
where it finds libpq.so. If ldconfig does not find libpq.so, either add an 
appropriate entry to /etc/ld.so.conf and re-run ldconfig or add the path to 
the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
A typical error message resulting from not finding libpq.so is: 

  install_driver(Pg) failed: Can't load './blib/arch/auto/DBD/Pg/Pg.so' 
  for module DBD::Pg: File not found at 

If you get an error message like:

  perl: error while loading shared libraries:
  /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/i386-linux/auto/DBD/Pg/Pg.so: undefined
  symbol: PQconnectdb

when you call DBI->connect, then your libpq.so was probably not seen at
build-time. This should have caused 'make test' to fail; did you really
run it and look at the output? Check the setting of POSTGRES_LIB and
recompile DBD-Pg.
 
Some linux distributions have incomplete perl installations.
If you have compile errors like "XS_VERSION_BOOTCHECK undeclared", make a
          'find .../lib/perl5 -name XSUB.h -print'
If this file is not present, you need to recompile and re-install perl.

SGI users: if you get segmentation faults make sure, you use the malloc which 
           comes with perl when compiling perl (the default is not to).
           "David R. Noble" <drnoble@engsci.sandia.gov>

HP users: if you get error messages like:
              can't open shared library: .../lib/libpq.sl
              No such file or directory
          when running the test script, try to replace the 
          'shared' option in the LDDFLAGS with 'archive'.

FreeBSD users: if you get during make test the error message:
    'DBD driver has not implemented the AutoCommit attribute'
    recompile the DBI module and the DBD-Pg module and disable
    optimization. This error message is due to the broken
    optimization in gcc-2.7.2.1.

Sun Users: if you get compile errors like:
           /usr/include/string.h:57: parse error before `]'
           then you need to remove from pgsql/include/libpq-fe.h
           the define for strerror, which clashes with the definition
           in the standard include file.


Win32 Users: Running DBD-Pg scripts on Win32 needs some configuration work
             on the server side:
             - add a postgres user with the same name as the NT-User (eg Administrator)
             - make sure, that your pg_hba.conf on the server is configured, 
               such that a connection from another host will be accepted
