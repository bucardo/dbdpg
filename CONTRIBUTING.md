# How to Contribute

Help with DBD::Pg is always welcome. You do not have to know any code to help out - 
we also need help testing, answering questions, improving documentation, etc.


## Issues

Bugs and problems can be reported at:

https://github.com/bucardo/dbdpg/issues


## Questions

Questions about usage can be answered in a number of places:

### IRC

You may find helpful people at #postgresql on irc.libera.chat

Lower volume but more technical discussions happen at #dbi on irc.perl.org

### Slack

The Slack channel #general at postgresteam.slack.com is full of helpful people

### Email

There is a low-volume mailing list for discussion about this module

Send an email to <dbd-pg@perl.org>. Before doing so, you probably want to 
subscribe by sending an email to dbd-pg-subscribe@perl.org


## Testing

You can help by testing DBD::Pg as widely as possible. Running the tests 
on a wide variety of platforms, Postgres versions, DBI versions, and other 
factors is a great help in uncovering problems and improving DBD::Pg


## Code development

Development happens in a git repo. The canonical location is currently 
at https://github.com/bucardo/dbdpg

Create your own copy of the repo by running:

git clone https://github.com/bucardo/dbdpg.git

See the README.dev file for more information about developing DBD::Pg
